Under the hood gRPC relies on HTTP/2 for:</p>
<ul>
<li>multiplexing - a single TCP connection can handle many RPC calls (concurrently). <img src="/computing/data/graphics/binary-enocde-multiplex.png" alt="binary-enocde-multiplex" /></li>
<li>header compression</li>
<li>duplex streaming
<strong>Note</strong>, REST APIs are built on HTTP 1.1</li>
</ul>
