<h2>Builtins Commands Versus Commands located on <code>PATH</code></h2>
<p><em>Most</em> commands come from a program on the file system. In contrast, some commands, out of necessity need to be baked into the shell's program file (making it a <strong>builtin</strong>) because the command affects the current shell. For this reason and efficiencies (a bloated shell file) commands are either placed in the builtins or on <code>PATH</code></p>
<h4>Shell Builtins</h4>
<ul>
<li>These commands do not start separate process.
<code>$ type pwd</code>
<code>pwd is a shell builtin</code>
Same information can be found by using the <code>which</code> command</li>
</ul>
<h4>File System Commands</h4>
<ul>
<li>located on the <strong>PATH</strong> variable</li>
</ul>
<h4>Builtin example <code>alias</code></h4>
<ul>
<li>they are created using shell builtins because <code>alias</code> stores an <code>alias</code> the currently running shell process, so t must be a builtin
<code>$ type alias</code>
<code>alias is a shell builtin</code></li>
</ul>
